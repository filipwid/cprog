# Lab 6: Lambdas and smart pointers

In this assignment you will work with [lambdas](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda) and [smart pointers](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory).


## Questions to answer

Put questions and answers in a file _inquiry.md_ and do put relevant code examples if needed for clarity.

#### What did you learn in this assignment?


#### What is a capture list in a lambda expression?


#### What does & mean inside the capture list?


#### When could capturing data by reference [&] be useful?


#### What does {4} in the code below do?
```
        A * p = new A {4} ;
```

#### Why is it a compile error to call foo with a unique_ptr without a move?
```
        foo(pa);
```

#### Was there ever a memory leak when calling foo2 with a shared pointer?


#### What is the use of a weak_ptr?


#### How do you create a unique_ptr with a special deleter?


#### What is _decltype_ ?


#### What is std::function?


You will need to include the following libraries in this
assignment. Namespace std:: is used for clarity.
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <memory>
#include <functional>
#include <thread>

using namespace std;
```


# Lambdas

```c++
//...
{
    vector<int> v = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    // printing v
    cout << "vector v:" << endl;
    for (auto x : v) { cout << x << " ";};
    cout << endl;

```

Write a for_each statement that uses a lambda expression to print
odd numbers in vector v.

```
    for_each(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), // YOUR LAMBDA HERE
```

* Write another for_each statement that changes the values in v by
multipliying all odd numbers by 2.

* Write a for_each statement that changes the vector elements by
  adding the size of the vector to all elements.


* Write a lambda function on our own that changes any data of your choice
  outside the scope of the lambda by capturing with [ & ].

example:
```c++

   //...
   int OUTSIDEDATA

   // ....  [ & OUTSIDEDATA ]( // YOUR LAMBDA

```

# Smart pointers

The following code will be used

```c++
struct A {
    int data;

};

void foo(unique_ptr<A> p) {
    cout << p->data << endl;
}

void foo2(shared_ptr<A> p) {
    cout << p->data << endl;
}

```

Define a unique_ptr to A inside an arbitrary scope and print the data

```

    {
        unique_ptr<A> pa(new A {4} );
        cout << pa -> data;
```


Try calling _foo_ with your unique_ptr. There is a compile error
because you are calling by value, trying to copy the pointer.

```
        foo(pa);
```

Fix the compile error by using move when calling foo. Run valgrind (see
preparations) on your executable and verify that there are no memory
leaks.

### Shared ptr

Declare a shared pointer to A and print the data

```c++
        shared_ptr<A> sa(new A {5});
        cout << sa -> data;
```

Call foo2 first normally and then by moving. Run valgrind on both executables. Is there a memory leak?

```c++
        foo2(sa);            // check with valgrind
        //foo2(move(sa));    // check with valgrind
```

### Weak pointer

Constructing a weak pointer as a shared pointer generates a compile error

```C++
        weak_ptr<A> wa(new A {5});
```

Construct a weak pointer to the previous shared pointer and try print the
data. There will be a compile error.

```C++
        weak_ptr<A> wa = sa;
        cout << wa->data;
```

Use the _lock_ member function to print the data field.


### Circular dependencies

Given BhasA and AhasB

```c++
struct BhasA;

struct AhasB {
    AhasB(shared_ptr<BhasA> b) : m_b(b)  {
        resource = new int[4];
    };

    shared_ptr<BhasA> m_b;
    int * resource;

    ~AhasB() {delete [] resource;}
    AhasB(const AhasB &) = delete;
    void operator=(const AhasB &) = delete;
};

struct BhasA {
    BhasA() {resource = new int[4];};

    shared_ptr<AhasB> m_a;
    int * resource;

    ~BhasA() {delete [] resource;}
    BhasA(const BhasA &) = delete;
    void operator=(const BhasA &) = delete;
};

```

Declare one instance each of AhasB and BhasA and link them.

```C++
        shared_ptr<BhasA> bptr(new BhasA);
        shared_ptr<AhasB> aptr(new AhasB(bptr));

        bptr->m_a=aptr;
```

There is a memory leak when you run valgrind on the code because of
the circular dependency. Fix the memory leak by changing one of the
shared_ptr members to a weak pointer. Go back and check if your
solution to lab_04 (loosing chess) has any memory leaks due to
circular dependencies. 

### Using a deleter

Given B

```c++
struct B {
    B() { b = new int[4]; }

    int * b;
    ~B() { delete [] b; }
    B(const B &) = delete;
    void operator= (const B & ) = delete;
};
```

Unless the compiler detects it, there will a memory leak when declaring a unique_ptr as below. Verify
the memory leak with valgrind.

```c++
        unique_ptr<B> pb(new B[2]);
```

The memory leak is because the unique_ptr assumes it points to a single
object not to an array.

In order to fix the memory leak you need to create a function that
does a correct deletion of the objects. 

Write a lambda function that does a correct deletion of the array


```c++
        auto deleter = // YOUR LAMBDA HERE
        unique_ptr<B, decltype(deleter)> pb2(new B[2], deleter);
```


If you know the signature of your lambda function you can declare it
with the _function_ keyword directly instead of using auto

```c++
        function<void(B*)> fb = // YOUR LAMBDA
```

It is thus possible to declare the unique_ptr in one row

```c++
        unique_ptr<B, function<void(B*)> > pb1(new B[2],  // YOUR LAMBDA
```

_Note: In later standards its possible to specify the kind of pointer in the template parameter_
```c++
        unique_ptr< B[] > pb(new B[2]);    // Note B[]
```

# Concurrency

## A small concurrency example with a condition variable and lambda

Around a waterhole in Africa there is a huge cage with three
compartments, separated by gates according to this figure:
![alt text](images/HyenasAndGnus.jpg "A rectangle divided into three small rectangles by two vertical lines each spanning the full height of the rectangle. The left small rectangle is marked hyenas; the middle small rectangle is marked waterhole; and the right small rectangle is marked gnus.")

The left compartment is for the hyenas. The middle compartment is where the
water hole is. The right compartment is for gnus. Each animal will
sleep for a random amount of time then wake up to go and drink for a
random amount of time (smaller than sleeping) then go back to
sleep. If a gnu gets thirsty it may drink water if there are no hyenas
in the waterhole. A thirsty gnu that can't drink will have to wait. A
thirsty hyena may drink water if there are no gnus at the water
hole. The rules are enforced by opening and closing the gates between
each compartment.

The hyenas and gnus are simulated with threads where each thread is
initiated with either a gnu or a hyena function.

    vector<thread> threadvec;
    for (int i = 0; i < nrGnus; i++)
      threadvec.push_back(thread(gnu));
    for (int i = 0; i < nrHyenas; i++)
      threadvec.push_back(thread(hyena));

Upon creating the threads, the functions _gnu_ and _hyena_ will start running.
Join the threads with a similar loop

    for (auto& thread : threadvec)
    	thread.join();
    
and that is basically all your main simulating program needs to do. In order to compile
you may need to link to a pthread library ( -lpthreads ).

### _gnu_ and _hyena_ functions

The _gnu_ and _hyena_ functions are almost identical

```C++
void gnu(//...) {
   while (// run a number of simulations
     // sleep for a while
	 watermanager.gnuEnters();            // see monitoring class below
     // drink water for a while i.e. sleep for a short while
	 watermanager.gnuLeaves();
```

Use
[this_thread::sleep_for](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/sleep_for)
to put the thread to sleep.

### A water manager class

Write a monitoring class WaterManager that has four methods.

* hyenaEnters
* gnuEnters
* hyenaLeaves
* gnuLeaves

Let WaterManager have
a [condition_variabe](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable) CONDITIONVAR and
a [mutex](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex) as well as
two atomic integers with the current number of hyenas or gnus inside (_hyenasInside_, _gnusInside_).

Upon entering, create a local lock
([unique_lock](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/unique_lock) or
[lock_guard](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/lock_guard)) SOMELOCK and
call the condition_variable's wait-method with the lock and a lambda function.

example: (do change CONDITIONVAR and SOMELOCK to appropriate variable names)

```C++
     // A gnu has to wait until there are no hyenas
     CONDITIONVAR.wait(SOMELOCK, [this] {return hyenasInside == 0;});
	gnusInside += 1;
```


Upon exiting, lock the WaterManagers mutex and update
_hyenasInside_/_gnusInside_. Then notify all threads with
the condition_variable's notify_all() method (CONDITIONVAR.notiy_all()).

### Trace outputs

Implement trace outputs that can easily be turned on or off. Decide if
turning trace outputs should be a compile option or a runtime option
or both.

Each thread has a unique id that can be reached with
[get_id](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/get_id).

#### use an unordered map

Instead of printing the thread id, create an
[unordered_map](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map)
with [thread::id](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/id)
as key and a more human-readable string (example Gnu nr 3) as value as you create the threads.
Use the mapped string in your trace outputs.

#### Iterating over an unordered map
Implement a loop over the map and print each key and value, take notice of the order
the items are printed.

Place significant trace outputs inside the _gnu_ and _hyena_ functions
so you can follow the code. An example is given below. Notice how
three hyenas have to wait until the cave is empty whereupon they all
enter. Experiment with different wait times and upload a few trace
outputs to git.

The trace outputs below only show the water cave status when any animal enters the
water cave. Make your own opinion if the status information below is enough.

```
Gnu 2 is thirsty
A gnu enters the water cave         hyenas = 0         gnu = 1
Gnu 3 is thirsty
A gnu enters the water cave         hyenas = 0         gnu = 2
Hyena 2 is thirsty
Gnu 1 is thirsty
A gnu enters the water cave         hyenas = 0         gnu = 3
Gnu 2 finished drinking and exits the water cave
Hyena 1 is thirsty
Hyena 3 is thirsty
Gnu 3 finished drinking and exits the water cave
Gnu 1 finished drinking and exits the water cave
A hyena enters the water cave       hyenas = 1       gnu = 0
A hyena enters the water cave       hyenas = 2       gnu = 0
A hyena enters the water cave       hyenas = 3       gnu = 0
Hyena 2 finished drinking and exits the water cave
Hyena 1 finished drinking and exits the water cave
Hyena 3 finished drinking and exits the water cave
```

## Using a function operator (functor, function object)

Create a class Gnu. Implement at least the following

```C++
Gnu::Gnu(int id) { ...           // constructor, id is the number of the Gnu
void Gnu::operator()()  { ....   // function operator - copy gnu function here
ostream & std::operator<<(ostream & os, const Gnu & g) { ...  // print the Gnu
```

Copy the code from _gnu_ function you wrote earlier into the function operator. Replace the calls  
to the unordered_map and print the gnu object directly instead.

Use a function pointer to point to the function operator and
initialize the thread with the function pointer in your main program.

```C++
      Gnu g = Gnu(24);
      std::function<void(void)> threadjob = g;
      threadvec.push_back(thread(threadjob));
````
