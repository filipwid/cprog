# Lab 4 Chesspieces, AI and Losing chess
To run main, first compile the files with "make all", then run the program with three command lines, the first one stating which AI white will use, the second stating which AI black will use, and the third stating who goes first.
As stated "As before the game should be initialized by reading a starting board", the board needs a input to read from. The normal chess starting board can be found in test.in. An example of running the program is "./runner smart smart white < test.in"

 The board print seems to be very ugly, but I'm not sure what to do about it. It seems to be based on what font and what command line it uses. I use Ubuntu on WSL and specifically the white pawns have some space to the left of them while no other pieces have it.
